# Git_lab

Intigrate gitlab with other applications:

When you use a self-signed certificate to integrate GitLab with external applications, you might encounter SSL certificate errors.

Configure SSL for a Linux package installation:

Starting from version 17.5, GitLab uses OpenSSL 3.

Configure HTTPS:

# 1.To enable HTTPS:

Edit /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb:

Set the external_url to your domain. Note the https in the URL:

external_url "https://gitlab.example.com"

# 2.Disable the Letâ€™s Encrypt integration:
letsencrypt['enable'] = false

# 3. Create the /etc/gitlab/ssl directory and copy your key and certificate there:
sudo mkdir -p /etc/gitlab/ssl

sudo chmod 755 /etc/gitlab/ssl

sudo cp gitlab.example.com.key gitlab.example.com.crt /etc/gitlab/ssl/

# Change the default HTTPS port
If you need to use an HTTPS port other than the default (443), specify it as part of the external_url:

Edit /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb:

external_url "https://gitlab.example.com:2443"

sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure

# Adding trusted root certificates to the server
If you want to send or receive messages signed by root authorities and these authorities are not installed on the server, you must add a trusted root certificate manually.

Linux (Ubuntu, Debian): 

To Add: 
Copy your CA to dir /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/

Use command: sudo cp foo.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/foo.crt

Update the CA store: sudo update-ca-certificates

To Remove:

Remove your CA.

Update the CA store: sudo update-ca-certificates --fresh
